# Predicting Customer Churn and Segmentation 

Primary objective was to predict customers at the risk of churn using an ecommerce industry data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) and different model algorithms.

## Repository Contents and Path

The notebooks in this repository follows a sequential path:

- **Notebook #1 - Data Cleaning and Wrangling**
In this notebook, I loaded the raw dataset from the source, Kaggele datasets, merge the datasets, and cleaned the merged data where applicable. 

- **Notebook #2 - Feature Engineering**
In this notebook, I loaded the cleaned up from notebook, and feature engineered dataset, create new datasets to be used in notebooks 3, 4 and 5. 

- **Notebook #3 - Data Exploration**
In this notebook, I did some exploratory data analysis to obtain insights from the data prior to modelling.

- **Notebook #4 - Modeling**
In this notebook, the preprocessed feature engineered from Notebook 2 was used for modeling. I transformed the dataset priot to modeling. 

- **Notebook #5 - Unsupervised Learning** 
In this notebook customers were segmented using k-means clustering.
